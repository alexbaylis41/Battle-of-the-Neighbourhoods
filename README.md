# Battle-of-the-Neighbourhoods
Analysing Toronto Neighbourhoods using K-means Clustering

In this project i have attempted to segment and cluster Toronto neighbourhoods using location data from the Foursquare api service.

The location information would be useful for anybody perhaps looking to relocate in a new city, or set up a new busisness.

Skills utilised:

1.Web scraping data using Beautiful soup
2.Data wrangling using pandas dataframes
3.Making calls to the Foursquare api to collect location data
4.One hot encoding data for use in unsupervised learning 
5.Utilising K-means clustering to segment and compare Toronto neighbourhoods
6.Folium maps for interacting and displaying clusters clearly
